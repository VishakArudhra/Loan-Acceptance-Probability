# Loan-Acceptance-Probability
In this project, I groom the data by removing impurities of many sorts, examine the distribution and impact of each feature and perform prediction using three models namely: Logistic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes. Finally, I compare and evaluate the performance efficiencies of all three models. 

The performance is evaluated through the usage of confusion matrices classification reports which display the correct classifications and misclassifications and finally the competence in performance of each model in the prediction of acceptance of a loan is reasoned for.
